Jupyter notebook that fits T1 maps using our demo dataset. Click on the Binder button above to open a Binder session that runs the notebook, then run all cells. The notebook takes about 10-15 minutes to run.

### Note

This current demo script has only been designed for processing a magnitude dataset. Demos for complex datasets (magnitude/phase, real/imaginary) will come later. Help is always welcome by opening an issue or pull request.
